âš¡ LSTM-Based Time Series Forecasting for Energy Consumption

This project applies Deep Learningâ€”specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networksâ€”for time series forecasting of energy consumption data. The model is trained to predict daily electricity consumption based on historical usage data. It is inspired by Mohamad Nachawatiâ€™s open project and thesis.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

To develop an LSTM-based deep learning model capable of predicting daily energy consumption using historical time series data. The prediction model is focused on aiding:

Smart energy planning

Renewable energy optimization

Load balancing and infrastructure efficiency

ðŸ”„ Workflow Overview

1. Load and explore dataset
2. Clean and preprocess the time series data
3. Resample hourly data to daily mean values
4. Normalize data using MinMaxScaler
5. Split into training, validation, and testing sets
6. Reshape data to 3D for LSTM input: [samples, time_steps, features]
7. Build a stacked LSTM model with Dropout
8. Train the model and evaluate with RMSE
9. Visualize predictions vs actual consumption
